        <h3>A city with a profound history !
                <p> Nantes' historical nickname was "Venice of the West" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit√© des Ducs "the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence </p>

        <h3>A great place to visit !
            <p>There is a lot to see in Nantes. From the castle of the dukes, to the elephant-robot, to the natural history museum, you won't be able to miss the time passing by.
              If you want to rest, I'll advise you The Radisson Blue Hotel that is perfectly located in the city center. You can have a beer or a glass of Wine at the Bar the Pickwick, people are very friendly there !

        <h3>Nantes vibrates for it's football team !</h3>
            <p>The elephant is not the only emblem of Nantes. The city is best known for its football team and passionate supporters. The stadium, named "La Beaujoire" has been described many times as the best atmosphere of the whole championship.</p>
